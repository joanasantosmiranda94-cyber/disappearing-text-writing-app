# Disappearing Writing App

## Overview
This is a simple web application that allows users to write in a text area where their words **disappear automatically** if they stop typing for 5 seconds. The project uses a clean, responsive template from **HTML5 UP – Spectral** and is fully static (HTML, CSS, JS).

The project contains two main pages:  

- `index.html` – Home page / landing page  
- `text.html` – Disappearing Writing App page  

---

## Features

- **Disappearing text:** The text disappears after 5 seconds of inactivity, encouraging focused, uninterrupted writing.  
- **Responsive design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices using a modern template.  
- **Clean and minimal UI:** Uses a styled `<textarea>` with smooth fade-out effect.  
- **Static website:** No backend needed – can be hosted easily on GitHub Pages.  

---

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to access the home page.  
2. Navigate to **Disappearing Writing App** via the menu or open `text.html` directly.  
3. Start typing in the text area.  
4. If you stop typing for 5 seconds, the text will disappear.
